## Project Overview
This is a React version of the Conductor application - a learning management platform for UCSD Software Engineering courses.

## Tech Stack
- React 18+ with Vite
- React Router for navigation
- Express.js backend (shared with original conductor-app)
- PostgreSQL database
- Passport.js for Google OAuth authentication

## Development Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Maintain component modularity and reusability
- Keep services separate for API calls
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling

## Project Status
- [x] Create copilot-instructions.md file
- [x] Scaffold React+Vite project structure
- [x] Install dependencies and verify setup
- [x] Set up folder structure (components, pages, services)
- [x] Configure React Router and basic routing
- [x] Create documentation and verify project

## Current Implementation
- Landing page with authentication flow
- Multiple role-based dashboard pages
- React Router configuration with routes
- API service layer for backend communication
- Vite proxy configuration for API calls
- ESLint setup for code quality

## Next Steps
- Implement authentication context and state management
- Create protected route components
- Build out dashboard components
- Add UI component library
- Implement error handling and loading states
